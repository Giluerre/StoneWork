In this experiment the SR-MPLS topology is configured in one direction only.
From c1, via c2 to c4, to mimic the example depicted here:
https://wiki.fd.io/view/VPP/Segment_Routing_for_MPLS
Manual configuration is used, i.e. VPP configuration is entered using
cli config file defined in startup.conf and serves as preparation for
potential future integration of StoneWork with VPP mpls.

To test the SR-MPLS, run:
$ make start-topology

and then go to client and server by:
$ docker exec -it ip4-client bash
$ docker exec -it ip4-server bash

then try to ping the server from client:
client $ ping 2.2.2.2 -I tap-c1

and watch incoming packets on server:
server $ tcpdump -nvvXXes 0 -i tap-c4 icmp

if you see incoming pings, then everything is good.

NOTE: You will not see a response on client side, since SR-MPLS is configured
in one way only.

finally to shutdown the topology run:
$ make stop-topology

TODOs
-----
* Automate the test as Makefile rule.
* Create next example for both direction, but also retain this unidirectional
  one as it is simple for understanding.
